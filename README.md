# MediaWikiBitcoinCash
Integrating MediaWiki and Bitcoin Cash. 

This is an idea about how to integrate Bitcoin Cash into MediaWiki.

MediaWiki is the software that runs Wikipedia.

Every MediaWiki edit should cost a minimal amount of satoshis for non-members. Alternatively, it could cost some Bitcoin Cash to sign up, and then editing will be included in membership. Dues could be billed yearly or monthly.

You should be able to tip editors.

The wiki should be easily forkable.

Self serve advertising could be built into MediaWiki. Advertisers could pay with Bitcoin Cash.

Paying wiki members would not see ads.
